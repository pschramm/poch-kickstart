abstract : "An artist's book in two structures. The text is on a loosely sewn codex glued at the verso of the last leaf to the middle part of a trifold wrapper; a mounted color photographic illustration appears on one page. Further images are printed on a 15 x 120 cm. sheet folded into six leaves and similarly attached to the rightmost part of the wrapper; another illustration is mounted on the topmost page of the folded sheet. The wrapper features a snakeskin-patterned exterior with a grained brown interior."
