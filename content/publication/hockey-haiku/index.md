abstract : "The greatest collection of hockey-related poetry this or any house has ever published, and a watershed moment in American letters.

Hockey haiku is the most rarefied of the haiku genres, and it represents the perfect union of graceful brutality, ordered chaos, and the blood that courses through our veins...and onto the ice."

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: "Hockey Haiku: The Essential Collection is full of poems that embody to perfection hockey's unique harmony of beauty and violence. "
