abstract : "Poetry. In TEXASES, his fifth collection of poems, John Poch offers readers a kaleidoscope through which to view his home stateâ€”its geography and people, its past and present. Here is a mix of forms (prose poems, formal poems, free verse) and moods (awe, critique, humor) as vast and varied as the Texas landscape."
